<p>Ive done activities that most poeple havent done or expirenced yet, im here to tell you about my favorite past time hobbie that I ever done.
<br> Throughout my years of adventuring What really stuck out to me was out door activites which include backpacking, rockclimbing, and fishing ect.</br>
<br> There are many benifits to doing out door activities, Spending time in nature and the natural light can improve your mood and reduce stress and depression. Not only that but your
body can get stronger. Its true that Outdoor activites can help you be more athletic but, what if doing out door hobbies suck as rockclimbing a little to intense. In that case you can 
always go for a walk outside or hike easy trails that arent very difficult.</p>

</ul>
<p>Eventhough it is hard to go hard activitys out door activities are one of the bet ways to become more athletic, loose weight, and gain muscles. I incourage everyone who reads this to
at least try to do new things outdoors so you can grow physically.</p>
